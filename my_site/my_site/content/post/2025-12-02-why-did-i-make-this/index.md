**HI!** My name is Brianna Jarvis (more well known as BJ) and I am a student at the University of Michigan studying Ecology, Evolution, and Biodiversity with a minor in Creative Writing. I made this website as a project for **ANTHRBIO 463: Statistical Modeling and Data Visualization in R**, with hopes to use R and my newfound comfortability with using it to exhibit my poetry and prints in one place!
