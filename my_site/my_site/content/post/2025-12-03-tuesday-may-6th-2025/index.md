**Tuesday, May 6th, 2025**
	
Once the majority of my body was covered in familiar scratches and bruises, evidence of an enthusiastic welcome-home by my three dogs, my mind fell back into my body. I think I experience jet lag on a mental level even when not crossing time zones. It’s inherently weird to move from one family to another. Where at school, I am constantly surrounded by warm bodies to nudge shoulders and share a pint of ice cream with, here I am never really surrounded by anyone—I am lucky to see my friends once every full moon. 
	
It’s not always a bad kind of difference, but it’s definitely different. It’s like meditation, you have to learn to live with yourself, sit with yourself, listen to your thoughts instead of sharing them. Thank god I had a whole year of physical quarantining to make me good at that! If only. 
	
Anyway, **Saturday**, arriving at Burlington International Airport at noon after starting my journey from UM’s campus at 3am that morning was definitely… something! My whole family came to pick me up, seeing as it was a Saturday, what a delight (sarcasm). It was fine, they’re bearable. My day had been brightened just a little bit by running into my second-grade homeroom teacher and my middle school history teacher (they’re married, small town) before boarding my second flight at Philadelphia International Airport gate F6 and being randomly-assigned an aisle seat in the row right behind first class—or whatever they’re called on cheap American flights (more leg room!), so I could put up with some bickering and my mother’s insistence on buying more—and therefore, wasting more time—at the grocery store than she intended. I made it home eventually and my dogs were ultra-glad to see me, so the house isn’t all hostility and bore.
	
On **Sunday**, I drove 30 minutes north to kidnap my best friend Gabby and drive an hour south for some thrifting and grub on the mainland. Yes, for any of you that are not aware of the intricacies of my life outside of school, my hometown is an island on Lake Champlain in Northwestern Vermont, bordering New York and Canada, and I have to drive 30 minutes to the mainland to do… pretty much anything. I drove 35 minutes one-way to high school, every day, for four years. There’s some charm to it. I am not constantly surrounded by corporate capitalism and the hustle of it all in Grand Isle, which is appealing to me and the chip on my shoulder. Here, we have family-owned markets, delis, farms, and restaurants; everyone working at them and visiting them is someone you’ve known somehow (maximum 2 degrees of separation); and you can often find them at a booth at the Champlain Islands Farmers Market on Wednesdays and Saturdays—once the weather permits. I joke that we’re about 50 years behind the rest of the nation, but it’s a nice break from the sometimes crushing energy at a place like UM. 
	
Anyway, I got to see the light of my life, Gabby, who I wish I could make miniature and bring with me everywhere—seeing as her joy is my joy and her turmoil is mine to carry with her–but instead I settle for the occasional hangout, which mostly consists of driving long distances and barely talking to each other over the music we both love. I wouldn’t trade it for anything. We had a good, simple day and I got to buy her dinner and look at her beautiful face and be rejuvenated by her energy. 
	
It’s **Monday** and I have yet to go back to work on the farm, seeing as the fields are too wet to plant anything. So, I made the most of my day and did… nothing. Well, my self-hating, perfectionist, too-hard-on-myself version of nothing. I drove back into town to do some grocery shopping, seeing as my family barely ever has enough food in the pantry to feed the rest of them. Once I was home my dad recruited me for a walk with Jack and Alex, where Jack proceeded to twirl like a ballerina in excitement and then pull the leash so hard that he choked until he ran out of breath. He’s learning. They both have gotten better at staying calm in the presence of moving things than they were when we took them on their infamous first walk after getting them in 2023. Lastly, I made peanut butter chocolate chip cookies, because that’s what my family looks forward to most when I come home. Apparently I’m the only one who can bake things around here… 
	
BJ’s PB and CC cookies:
- Cream 1 cup of PB, 1 cup of white sugar, and 1 cup of brown sugar together. 
- Add 2 eggs, one at a time, beating well.
- Add 1 tsp of baking soda, 1 tsp of baking powder, and 1 tsp of vanilla. 
- Stir in 2 ½ cups of flour. 
- Roll into balls (approx. 1.5 inch wide/thick) on a cookie-safe sheet/pan. Makes about 30 cookies. 
- Bake at 350 degrees F for ~12 minutes (could need more these guys are weird). 
	
	Definitely not a diet-safe choice with their basically eight pounds of sugar, but they're delicious. 
	
Today is **Tuesday** and I finally had some energy to get myself to do something more fulfilling. I went to the gym for the first time in almost two months and ran my first non-stop mile in two years! I definitely had not gone to the gym with that intention, but I started the run and felt so good the whole time that I just kept increasing the speed until I had run a mile. Usually I need at least one walking break in there, but it seems as though the running gods were with me today. Then, I did some tricep/bicep/back workouts (because I’m indecisive) and called it a day. Came home, washed the dishes, ran the dishwasher, and read some of Bitch: On the Female of the Species by Lucy Cooke (finished the chapter on motherhood and how its not inherent in all female individuals of animals species just as it's not in all human’s with uteri) and Heroes of Olympus: The Blood of Olympus by Rick Riordan (yes, this is the second Percy Jackson series, they’re “sedating” Nike as her Greek and Roman forms fight each other right now). Now, here I am! Writing to you! These blogs/newsletters definitely will not always be sent out on Tuesday’s, but I really felt the itch to write today. 
	
**Tomorrow**, I have my first day back at the farm—bright and early at 7am. I’m only a bit more excited than I am nervous. It’s awesome, fulfilling, outdoor work, but it’s also demanding and I tend to over-worry. Regardless, I am so looking forward to having my hand in some dirt, that’s for certain. 
	
Thanks for reading :) I promise these will become much more exciting and probably a little less philosophical as time goes on and I actually have things going on to occupy my days. For example, today my big challenges were getting myself to walk in the gym door and eating my dinner (mom’s tomato noodle soup and some buttered bread) without looking at a screen—trivial things that are upsettingly hard for someone like me. There’s something so great about having the time to work on these things, all the while it feels like too much time to think about how much work you want to do. It's all bittersweet, basically! But I’m alive, and thank god. 

This week’s playlist:
- Saturday: Spring Into Summer – Lizzy McAlpine (I’m always, forever, running back to you!)
- Sunday: New Perspective – Noah Kahan (this song is so devastatingly Vermont).
- Monday: Backslide – Twenty One Pilots (nothing like being back home with all that molded you into who you are! Good and bad alike!)
- Tuesday: Egg – Djo (this song is just so damn good.) 

	Until next time,
