- Here is the final code used to make the entirety of this website *after* all content uploads:

- All in all, this was damn hard but actually *very* fulfilling to make and I never knew there was a way for me to make a website (accessible to anyone) using only R (and not having to spend money on a domain)! This was an insanely awesome resource to find.

- I used Chat GPT when faced with errors during the commit, pull, push, and deploy processes because I often could not decipher what the errors meant on my own, as someone who isn't *that* much of an expert in R and has never used it for creative purposes. I was actually very proud of myself and satisfied with how little I had to use AI to help with this project though, and found that the previously listed resources were so helpful.

I learned so much in this process and am truly satisfied with what I made!
