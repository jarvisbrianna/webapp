thinking about reaching out to estranged friends
because something tells me they might be the next in town to die

if i take a walk a day
will it ever be enough to keep the premature death away?

i think its poisoning the water

listening to the children play in the campground
trying to imagine a lifetime where i run back to this place
without fear it’ll be where i lay for what’s left of a lifetime, i bask in the sound 

but they’re renovating the houses on the lake this summer
while my neighbors bike to school for free lunch 
it’s been a little hard to breathe through the smoke and
something still lives here 
but something still broken

i’m on a walk 
and the same deer fly has been following me for miles
i wish it didn’t all feel like some sick metaphor, scribbled on the road with sidewalk chalk

i miss my childhood dog
he would’ve loved pissing on your lawn
the grass on this side sure does look green
like the most beautiful thing any of them had ever seen

it followed me the whole way back to my room
made itself comfy in my bed, too
