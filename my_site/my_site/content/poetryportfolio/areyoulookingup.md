Sometimes it helps to consider that we are looking up at the same stars, but then sometimes it's comparable to how my dead dog and I are looking up at the same stars. I am as close to you as I am to heaven. And you are my best friend at the same time as you are nothing special to me. And I am always nothing special to you. So will you be looking up tonight?

I remember it like a hazy incantation of a childhood recurring dream. You standing, looking up at me through your eyelashes. I swore I could have picked you up and put you on my shoulders right then, bought you a plot of land and built a family home with a wraparound porch right then, paid for your body to lay eternally in the Earth next to mine right then. It was like looking every birthday wish I had ever made right in the eye. 

So will you be looking up tonight? I have heard the moon will be beautiful. I much prefer the sun. You always reminded me of the sun. I fail to remind you of anything worth remembering. You are reminded of me when you watch an animal march in the same unwavering line in the psychosis of captivity. An indication of a sadness that no one would ever want to remember, let alone spend the energy to love. I will be looking up tonight, but not until you are steadily looking at the back of your eyelids. 

And maybe you will grow to regret it, or maybe you will grow to resent me. But you will grow and I will close my eyes and hear the same enchanted echo of Please Please Please Please Please Please Please until I have memorized the feeling of getting in my own way, the phenomenon of self sabotage to the point of eternal loneliness and mere skin-melting pity from wandering eyes. 

So are you looking up? At the stars? At the moon? At a plane that reminds you of when you got to see the world? At the place where you once met my eyes? At the friend who reminds you of a soul lost to distance and time? At the man who will bring you a child? At the child who managed to bring you life? At the life that brought you to me? At the sheer enormity of my wasted time? At the heights my delusion brought me to before you grabbed my wrist and loosened its grip on me, then watched me plummet? 

Sometimes it helps to consider that we are looking up at the same stars, but then sometimes it's comparable to a slow life stuffed full of dying in every way known as I watch you live in every way without me.
