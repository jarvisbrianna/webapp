I thought I had known mountains, I thought I had known oceans, I thought I had known cold air and persistent sunlight, I thought I had known the Earth and the extent of its existence. When our plane first crossed over the mountains of Svalbard, I thought I had been foolish to think I’d known anything at all. 

It was unlike anything I had ever experienced before, it felt different just to breathe the air. Watching my closest friends, whom I’ve watched closely since I’ve known them, look around with slack jaws and a unique sparkle in their eyes. It would have been enough just to watch them experience it all, yet I was so lucky as to be there with them. 

All around me was embodied persistence, I learned that flowers can grow in the cold— beautiful, bright, purple flowers. Snow turned itself into water to make it through the summer, moss grew vibrant in the streams as the dry air sucked all moisture from my skin. Every animal there is programmed to blend with the environment in all its forms, just to survive. I had forgotten the world outside of myself, I had forgotten the lengths that some creatures have to go to, just to survive. 

I briefly grew wings, my excitement flying beside the puffin that my friends yelled “puffin! Puffin! Puffin!” at from the back of the boat. For a moment I knew how it felt to fly. A picture could not capture how magical it was to see with your own eyes something that had always felt like a fairytale your parents would tell you to keep you in school. Watching a reindeer graze in the plains, like hearing hooves on the roof on Christmas Eve. 

“They were all in search of something. Many found what they were looking for.” Written on the wall in the Svalbard museum. I don’t know what I had been looking for, but I know what I found. What did this trip teach me? There is a beacon of hope, ever-shining, even at 78 degrees North. Do not waste your life away mourning something you have yet to lose, especially when it's right in front of you. Keep your wonder and keep wandering. Things will die, and they will die in beauty. It is change that will keep you alive, and it is enough just to be alive. There is always another adventure to be had, this is not the end. I am grateful to be with love, anywhere.
