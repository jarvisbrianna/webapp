and when a tree sprouts from my ground bones there will be nothing left of the shape of my body or the elements of my intimacy. but my poems will prevail on loving tongues, the letters will stay sat at the bottom of a soul tie’s lockbox, a baby will know that it’s possible to live on.

i will live to grow old if it makes you sick, if the wrinkles of my undefined body and limitless softness send you to rage-induced blasphemy. i know it’s hard to let yourself change, i know it’s uncouth to be so free, i know you’re a coward. 

the only way you could take my soul is by prying it from the hands of the mummified friends that wrap my corpse in a warm embrace, deserving of its own heartbeat. because my being inspires unending life. and my life inspires perpetual love.

it must be bothersome to be so bound. it must be exhausting to be so cruel. it must be lonely to lay alone in your grave.
