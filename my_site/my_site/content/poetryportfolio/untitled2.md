as the water laps up on the shore only to recede,
as the thunder threatens to open the sky above me,
as i am reminded that it will always come back,
but it will never be easy.

as a brave one wades and the rain starts to dampen the sand,
as i wonder if they, too, are feeling a bit queasy,
as i wish to be as unmoving as the dune grass, and as vocal as the loons,
but the wind seems to have a way of commanding them much better than me. 

as it is a thrill to be allowed to cut it close,
as i hope that i will not be caught among the fallen trees,
as i recount that i may never find myself here again,
but a piece of my soul will grow within the leaves.

as all that i am has been changed,
as every living thing that has had me here has held me,
as sweetly as a mother should, and as a friend always would,
but the birds fly to shelter and the rain will not set them free.

as it is a blessing to have found myself here at all,
as i take the hand of the land that be,
as i learn to be alive from those we do not tell how to live,
and the future, like the horizon, is too foggy yet to see. 

it is too foggy yet to see.
it is too foggy to see.
it is too foggy.
