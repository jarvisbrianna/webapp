I was only 7 years old when Hurricane Irene flooded the causeway, and I don't remember much but crossing fingers on both hands as my dad put the pedal to the floor to get the old gray truck through the waters. Now I watch footage online of my brothers in Appalachia searching for their puppy as the double-wide washes away with the floods. It doesn’t matter much to me that we’re not related. 

I still knock on the car ceiling every time I make it through a yellow light, I learned that from my old friend who makes a living selling people upcycled clothing that makes them feel good. Whenever I see a deer, or the number 3, or a particularly good outfit, I think of her. We are attached by nothing particularly noteworthy other than many lunches together and a shared love for live music and a shared interest in the unknown. I haven’t hugged her in a while.

A childhood friend once gave me a beanie he bought me at our favorite band’s concert that I didn’t have the money to go to. It hangs in my closet to this day, and I think of him every time I listen to It Comes Back To You. He once told me that I was all he had in a moment of tenderness. Whenever I question my faith, or see a dog tag, or hear a mention of D&D, I think of him. We are attached by nothing particularly noteworthy other than many nerf gun fights and a youthful love in a treehouse and a shared struggle with miscommunication. He hasn’t talked to me in a while.

It doesn’t matter much to me that we’re not related, though.

I don’t wish to know what will happen when the flood waters make it to the other side of the mountains. When the lake ceases to protect us. When the news coverage fails to come. When the trees I sat under for years fall on me. When the farm I worked at becomes eroded. When the community I was raised in loses hope. When the treehouse is washed away. 

I do not wish to know what will happen when the bombs fall on my family. When the schools are reduced to rubble on the ground. When there is no more green. When it becomes political to demand that my family should have been able to live. 

It should not matter that it has not happened to you. I have never come to know a single human being I would be content with surrendering to such an evil end. I have never known the land to deserve such tragedies. I will not be bought. 

Our investment should not be contingent on whether it has happened to our kin. It has already happened to our kin. Our families in Appalachia, whose roads and homes and pets and beauty are now lost under debris. Our families in Gaza, whose children were dismembered in front of them and whose history is nothing but remnants in a big gray cloud. We should not watch the trees fold in on a family's home when the flood banks come loose and think “Thank god that didn’t happen to me.” We should not watch airstrikes rain on safe zones and think “It has nothing to do with me.”

I am standing here with hands held out to humans. We are interlocked across millennia and country lines and religions. I have been changed by every person I have ever come to know. I have love for them all. It does not matter much to me that we are not related. It does not matter much to me that we are separated now by years, and miles, and oceans, and evil. We are attached by nothing noteworthy other than the uniqueness of our existence and our tendency to search for something bigger and the love that burns through us as if the tenth eternal flame. What else is there to do but love each other, when we are the only beings that can?
