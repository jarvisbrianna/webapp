When I stopped believing in God it was easiest to eat until I was so full. So full that I could not comprehend possibly being hungry for anything more, and I never quite knew how to stop, even when satiation never came. Still, I learned to hope for my own shrinkage, rotted out like sour apples even the deer chose to leave behind in my yard back home. Because it was never enough to watch myself grow old, as I felt my own hands claw at the ribs that encaged the wrongness in me. 

Frozen grapes caked in raspberry jello dust, I was who I am now before I knew what it meant. A revolution waged in my childhood room the day we pulled the old carpet to find staples and dust and mold. I held myself in the middle of the empty room and wept as the paint dried. Convinced with no hesitation that it was something to be ashamed of. 

Cheese whiz and a pot headache, “One day, maybe, I can sit with the thought of you because I'll love them.” It seems the conversation always translates that way. It’s alright, I never wanted myself, or the implications of it all, either. It seems I’ll keep getting broader anyway, until my shoulders could hold the weight of two of you, all of my children, and all of my family’s shame. 

As for my love, I see strawberry fields in the summer. I’ve always struggled with such absolutes, have I not loved you as I should even though it’s different? I ask the trees. They dance for me still. Everything that I have ever been forced to leave behind was not left with claw marks, but instead with love letters and cheap connecting necklaces and handmade photo collages. 

Fresh zucchini and Cabot cheese we would pick up from the church basement. My mind wanders to a cucumber plant’s tender tendril wrapping around my finger as I clip its stock against a rope so it can extend higher above itself, like buckling a toddler into their booster seat so they have the chance to grow at all. I yearn to be needed without being the source. To nurture without owning. To be nurtured without conditions. 

Hot dogs and watermelon slices, my friends and I would indulge for our luxury picnics and end the night around the campfire. I made a home for them in the rottenness, where they could feel safe to talk about the stars. In my fervor, I mean to tell them: I wish I could immortalize us in the constellations so that I would never have to be away from you until my own light faded out. I know it seems outlandish but I don't think I ever actually cared about what I do with my life as long as it involves weekly dinner parties with you and the chance to give your children an insane amount of gifts on birthdays. 

Strawberry shortcake being prepped over the stove. In a world where a wedding is possible, I invite the people that protected me here and the ones that saved me there to witness each other's fire and fall in love with the flame, same as I did. And no one gets too drunk and no one takes it too far and I end the night with a smile on my face.

When I was young the best was hamburger helper and toasted bread. But at the dinner parties, I can tell you now who will bring the wine, and who will start the fire, and who will help me cook dinner, then who will riff over the sink as they clean the dishes, and who will realize they have the same name, and finally, who will make us all play cards and when I detest will tell me it's okay and I'm safe and there's nothing to prove and nothing to lose. And it is fun and I don't say too much or laugh too little, and to make myself shrink would be insulting. And I know who will stay the night because she always has, and she always will. When we wake up I make chocolate chip pancakes, for old times sake. She tells me she loves my college friends. I tell her: “I do too”, and she teases me for my sincerity. And we move to the living room to watch a movie and talk over the whole thing. 

Goulash, spaghetti, and mac and cheese. I was taught of loyalty as if it was what made a family. And I believed that love was a noun that meant marriage and children and monotony and fights and poverty and complacency and hunger and blood. But you showed me that love meant closeness and you showed me that love meant promise and you showed me that love meant perseverance and you showed me that love meant realness. Who you are is known to only you. And really I can’t say love means much else other than everything. And really I can’t say that love deserves to be bound in human consciousness. And really I’m getting too wordy, and profound, and arrogant. And really it’s just hard to comment on it. I never thought I’d be so lucky to feel full. 

My love is like the love my dogs have for the crumbs on my plate, like the fall breezes for the leaves on the pavement, like the snows for the imprints from foxes’ prowls, like the mountains for the horizon, like the lakes for the glass in the shallow, like the stars for the people that send wishes their way. And my hands are big enough to lend you leftovers from the farm and wish for nothing in return but that you eat. 

Because that’s worship, to me; making sure that every child knows what it’s like to be full.
