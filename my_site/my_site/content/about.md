Hello! I’m **Brianna**, a senior student at the University of Michigan studying Ecology, Evolution, and Biodiversity with a minor in Creative Writing. When I'm not horribly busy from being a student, I enjoy to write poetry and make prints using the linocutting method! :D 
I made this website hoping to give myself a way to display and store all my poetry and print pieces in one place!
This was created using Hugo and blogdown for my **ANTHRBIO 463: Statistical Modeling and Data Visualization in R** class!
